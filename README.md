# Persona RPG
## Overview
This is a simple RPG themed after the Shin Megami Tensei: Persona series of games by Atlus. This was created as homework for Week 4 of the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.

## How to Play
### Character Selection
The player is presented with 6 characters to choose from, with varying HP (Health Points) and Attack stats. The characters are as follows:
* Orpheus
	* Orpheus 60 HP and 10 Attack. He has the highest attack of any character but very little HP. He is a "glass cannon"; powerful but fragile.
	* He is the protagonist persona from Persona 3. He is based on the Greek mythological figure of the same name.
* Izanagi
	* Izanagi has 7 Attack and 80 HP. He is a bit on the squishy side, but with enough health to tank a bit of damage.
	* He is the protagonist persona from Persona 4. He is based on the Japanese mythological figure of the same name.
* Arsene
	* Arsene has 8 Attack and 70 HP. He is in between Orpheus and Izanagi in terms of build.
	* He is the protagonist persona from Persona 5. He is based on the literary figure Arsene Lupin.
* Nyx Avatar
	* Nyx Avatar has 150 HP and 2 Attack. He is the most durable character but has very little strength.
	* He is the final boss of Persona 3. He is the physical form assumed by the god Nyx, named after the Greek goddess.
* Izanami
	* Izanami has 120 HP and 4 Attack. She is a bit on the tankier side, but to a lesser extreme than Nyx Avatar.
	* She is the true final boss of Persona 4. She is based on the Japanese mythological figure of the same name.
* Yaldabaoth
	* Yaldabaoth has 100 HP and 5 Attack. He has the most evenly balanced stats.
	* He is the true final boss of Persona 5. He is based on the Gnostic idea of the "Demiurge", the being who created and maintains the Universe.

### Combat
Once you have selected a character, all other characters become enemies. Enemy characters have a higher Attack stat than their player-character counterparts.

You can choose which enemy characters to fight next. Once you have chosen an enemy, click on the Attack button. This will cause your character to damage the enemy, and the enemy to damage your character.

Continue fighting and deafeating enemies until there are none left, or until your character reaches 0 HP.

### Leveling
Every time you attack an enemy, your character's Attack is increased by its base value. For example: if you chose Izanami your attack would initially be 7. After you attack it will increase to 14, then 21, then 28, etcetera. This increase in Attack power persists between battles.

### Strategy
Though your Attack increases over time, your HP will be reduced by every enemy you fight, with no way to recover it. You must choose the order in which you fight your enemies carefully in order to survive through all 5 fights.

## Music
Each character has a theme song that plays while you are controlling them. These songs are composed by Shoji Meguro and come from the character's original games.

* Orpheus - "Mass Destruction"
	* This is the main battle theme from Persona 3.
* Izanagi - "Time to Make History"
	* This is one of the main battle themes from Persona 4 Golden.
* Arsene - "Last Surprise"
	* This is the main battle theme from Persona 5.
* Nyx Avatar - "Burn My Dread (Last Battle)"
	* This is the theme for the battle with Nyx in Persona 3.
* Izanami - "Fog"
	* This is the theme for Phase 1 of the battle with Izanami in Persona 4.
* Yaldabaoth - "Jaldabaoth"
	* This is the theme for Phase 1 of the battle with Yaldabaoth in Persona 5.
